Adds 11 new widget areas to the Hybrid WordPress theme framework using its action hooks.

== Description ==

*Hybrid Hook Widgets* is a plugin that creates new widget areas for the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid">Hybrid theme</a> and attaches them to the theme's action hooks.  Basically, it allows you to add widgets pretty much anywhere.

Typically, to add extra stuff to the theme, you must use one of *Hybrid's* action hooks.  This can be quite confusing to some users.  This plugin was created mainly for those users without much XHTML and PHP knowledge.  It allows them to take advantage of *Hybrid's* advanced hook system without the need to understand how it works.  Of course, even advanced users can take advantage of this, especially when dealing with client work.

This plugin is for **WordPress 2.8+ only**.

You must have the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid">Hybrid theme</a> installed to use it.

Full instructions for use can be found in the plugin's `readme.html` file, which is included with the plugin download.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `hybrid-hook-widgets.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.
3. Go to your *Widgets* panel and add widgets to the new widget area.

More detailed instructions can be found in the plugin's `readme.html` file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why create this plugin? =

It creates 11 new widget areas that *hook* into various parts of the theme.  This allows users to add widgets virtually anywhere.
